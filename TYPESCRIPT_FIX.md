# ðŸ”§ TypeScript Type Cache Issue - Quick Fix

## Issue
You may see TypeScript errors about `transactionId` not existing in Prisma types, even though it's in the schema.

## Why This Happens
VS Code's TypeScript server caches Prisma types and needs to be reloaded after schema changes.

## âœ… Quick Fix (Choose One)

### Method 1: Reload VS Code Window (Recommended)
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type: "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter
```

### Method 2: Restart TypeScript Server
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
2. Type: "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Press Enter
```

### Method 3: Close and Reopen VS Code
```
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen the project
3. TypeScript will use fresh types
```

## Verification

After reloading, the errors should disappear. The code is correct - it's just a TypeScript cache issue.

## Why The Code Is Correct

The `transactionId` field exists in your Prisma schema:

```prisma
model TrademarkApplication {
  // ... other fields
  transactionId String? // âœ… This field exists!
  paymentDate   DateTime?
  // ... other fields
}
```

And Prisma generated the types correctly:

```bash
âœ” Generated Prisma Client (v6.16.3)
```

The database also has the field (confirmed by `npx prisma db push`).

## Still Seeing Errors?

If errors persist after reloading:

1. **Check Prisma Client**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Verify Database**
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   # Check that transactionId column exists
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Clear Node Modules** (Nuclear option)
   ```bash
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
   npm install
   npx prisma generate
   ```

## Don't Worry!

This is a **common TypeScript caching issue** and doesn't affect functionality. The application will work perfectly fine even if VS Code shows these errors temporarily.

Once you reload the window, everything will be green! âœ…

**Quick Fix**: Just reload VS Code window and you're good to go! ðŸš€
